# SelkieDroneCode
These short MATLAB functions were written to assist pre-processing of video data prior to surface velocimetry analysis and post-processing of data output from various surface velocimetry codes.

The code is explained the the Selkie Project guidance document 'GUIDELINES FOR USING DRONES TO MAP SURFACE CURRENTS'

Scientific background to the code and approach can be found in:
